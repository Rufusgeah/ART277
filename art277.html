    <h1>Re: Albert Momo university application</h1>
    <br><hr><br>Dear Mr. Momo,
    <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the Starz University's science facuality
         to study as part of your <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year. I willanswer your questions one by one, in the 
         following sections.</p>

    <h2>Starting dates</h2>
    <br>We are happy to accomdate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester, the start dates for each one are as follow:
    <br><br>First semester: 9 october 22
    <br>Second semester :15 january 2023<br>Third semester: 2 May 2033
    <br><br>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which stat dates you would prefer.
    <br><br>You can find more information about important University dates on our website.
    <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
    At the Starz University,we have a pretty open-minded research facility&horbar;as long as the subjects fall somewere in the realm of science and technology. you see like an intelligent, dedicated reseacher, and just like the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. 
    Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we are most intrigued by area as follows, in order of priority:
     Turing H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)
     Measuring the effect on performance of the funk bassplayer at temperatures exceeding 30&deg;C (86&deg;F), when the audience sieze exponentially increases (effect of 3 &times; 10<sup>4</sup> increasing to 3 &times; 10<sup>4</sup> )
    <br><br><abbr title="Hyper Markup Text Language">  HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> construct for representing muscial scores.
    <br><br>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staffs and other resources,
    and anything you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
    <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
    Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal  dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
    <dl>
        <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
        <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would 
            dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</dd>
        <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
        <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as means of getting warm, they used to pratice this dance,
            which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly
            tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.
        </dd>
        <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
        <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s 
            believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted
            movements, being praticed by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this
            because they were really cold. 
        </dd>
    </dl>

Yours sincerely,<br><br> Prof. Henry Nana <br><br>
